# Business Plan for P2P IOU Marketplace

## Mission
Create a decentralised marketplace where users can trade goods and services using a mutual credit (IOU) system instead of blockchain.

## Value Proposition
- Instant peer-to-peer settlement.
- Cryptographically secure messages and signed IOUs.
- No central fees; cooperative ownership model.

## Revenue Streams
- **Voluntary commissions** on transactions to support development.
- **Premium features** such as encrypted cloud backups and analytics for community markets.
- **Community fund** for open-source maintenance and security audits.

## Funding Model
- Users can obtain cooperative shares, giving them voting rights on project direction.
- Donations funnelled into a transparent fund used for bug bounties and new features.

## Go-to-Market
1. Pilot with local cooperatives and barter groups.
2. Encourage referrals with non-monetary rewards.
3. Publish the protocol and libraries as open source to foster thirdâ€‘party apps.

## Roadmap
- Enhance the `smol-iroh` networking core with encryption and peer discovery.
- Provide mobile bindings (Android/iOS) for the IOU app.
- Launch community governance portal for decision making.
